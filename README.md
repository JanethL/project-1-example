# Tetris Challenge Part 1

In this guide, I will walk you through building the first part of a tetris game. We will apply our learnings from the first two weeks of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. 

 
# HOW TO PLAY 
This is a very simple game to play. The only required controls are the following:

1. **Left and Right arrow:** Moves the block left or right
2. **Down Arrow:** Accelerates the block's fall
3. **A & D Key:** Rotates the block
