# Tetris Challenge Part 1

In this guide, I will walk you through building the first part of a tetris game. We will apply our learnings from the first two weeks of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. 

 
# HOW TO PLAY 
This is a very simple game to play. The only required controls are the following:

1. **Left and Right arrow:** Moves the block left or right
2. **Down Arrow:** Accelerates the block's fall
3. **A & D Key:** Rotates the block

# HOW TO INSTALL

1. *`Fork`* and *`Clone`* this respository to your local machine
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to play or 
3. Open the directory in your text editor of choice to view or edit the code


# HOW IT WORKS
```javascript  ```


# FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

- Create 6 more blocks with if statements
- Create a function to randomly select a block
- Add colors to blocks 
- Need to add a game over screen
- Count filled rows using a for loop and clear rows once full
- Add a function that updates the score 
- Add styling to buttons
- Add SMS functionality with API to challenge friends to beat high score a game
